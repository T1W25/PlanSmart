# üîÅ Routes Documentation

This document describes the API routes used in the **Plansmart** backend to manage different types of users‚Äî**Vendors**, **Guest Speakers**, and **Transportation Providers**‚Äîalong with their associated portfolio media.

The backend follows a RESTful structure, where each entity (vendor, guest speaker, transportation provider) has dedicated endpoints for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` actions. Additionally, media management (uploading and deleting files like images and videos) is handled through integration with **Cloudinary**, and file parsing is managed using **Multer** middleware.

Each entity has its own router for managing profiles, and there's a shared router for handling portfolio updates and media uploads. This structure allows efficient code reuse and cleaner API logic.

- **POST `/api/portfolio/upload/:id`**  
  Upload an image or video to the provider‚Äôs portfolio. The file is resized (800x600) and stored in Cloudinary. The secure URL is saved to the `PastWorkMedia` array in the portfolio.

- **DELETE `/api/portfolio/media/:id`**  
  Remove a specific media file from both Cloudinary and the provider‚Äôs portfolio based on the media URL provided in the request body. This supports both images and video formats.

These routes make the platform flexible and scalable by enabling seamless CRUD operations across different provider types and centralizing portfolio/media management logic.
