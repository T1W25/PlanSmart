# Dashboard Page

## File
`Dashboard.jsx`

## Description
This component serves as the user dashboard, displaying profile information and a preview of the user's portfolio. It fetches user data from the backend and routes users to appropriate pages on interaction.

## Technologies Used
- React (Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- React Router (`useNavigate`) for page navigation
- Tailwind CSS for layout and styling

## Functional Overview

### State
- `userData`: Holds the retrieved user information from the backend.

### Hooks
- `useEffect`: Fetches user profile data from the backend when the component mounts.
- `useNavigate`: Enables programmatic navigation between routes.

## API Interaction
```js
axios.get("http://localhost:5050/api/transportation-providers/${userId}")
```
- Fetches transportation provider data by hardcoded test user ID.

## Rendered Components
- `<Navbar />`: The main navigation bar.
- `<ProfileCards />`: Renders profile info with rating and interactivity.
- `<PortfolioShowcase />`: Displays the two latest media items from the portfolio.

## Navigation Logic
- `onClick` in `<ProfileCards>` routes to `/pages/profileview`
- `onEditClick` in `<ProfileCards>` routes to `/pages/profileedit`
- `onEditClick` in `<PortfolioShowcase>` routes to `/pages/portfolioeditor`
- `onViewAllClick` in `<PortfolioShowcase>` routes to `/pages/portfoliodisplay`

## Example Usage
```jsx
<ProfileCards
  name={userData.Name}
  profession={userData.ProviderType}
  rating={userData.rating}
  onClick={() => navigate("/pages/profileview")}
  onEditClick={() => navigate("/pages/profileedit")}
/>
```

## Styling Notes
- `pt-24 px-6 w-full`: Ensures proper spacing from the fixed navbar.
- `space-y-6`: Vertically separates child components.
- Tailwind utilities are used extensively for responsiveness and layout.

## Notes
- `userId` is currently hardcoded for testing purposes.
- Error handling is basic; improvement could include user notifications.


# PortfolioEditor.jsx

## Description
The `PortfolioEditor` component is used to view, update, and manage a user's portfolio. This includes editing the portfolio type and description, uploading media files (images or videos), and adding awards dynamically. It interacts with a backend API to perform CRUD operations.

## Props
- `modelId` (string): The unique ID of the user/entity whose portfolio is being edited. Defaults to a hardcoded test ID.
- `initialPortfolio` (object): Optional preloaded data for the portfolio, used to populate the form initially.
- `entityType` (string): Specifies the type of entity (e.g., "vendor"). Default is "vendor".

## Features
- Users can update the **Type** and **Description** fields of their portfolio.
- Users can upload media (images or videos) and preview them before submission.
- Each media file is uploaded to the server via a POST request to `/api/portfolio/upload/:id`.
- Users can add multiple **awards** by pressing Enter.
- Awards are displayed as a list below the input field.
- Final submission uses a PUT request to update portfolio text fields at `/api/portfolio/:id`.

## Key Functions

### `handleChange`
Updates the state for Type and Description input fields.

### `handleAwardAdd`
Captures award input on Enter keypress, updates the awards list, and resets the input field.

### `handleFileChange`
Handles the selection of a file and generates a local preview URL for display.

### `handleUpload`
Uploads selected media file to the server using FormData and appends the URL to the media list.

### `handleSave`
Sends a PUT request to update Type and Description for the portfolio.

## UX Features
- **Preview Section**: Displays either an image or video preview based on file type.
- **Dynamic Award Input**: Adds award items to a list via the Enter key.
- **Stylized Buttons**: Upload and Submit buttons with clear visual feedback.

## Sample API Calls

### Upload Media

POST /api/portfolio/upload/:id
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

### Update Text Fields

Body: {
  "Type": "Photography",

}
```

  entityType="vendor"
/>
```

## Styling
