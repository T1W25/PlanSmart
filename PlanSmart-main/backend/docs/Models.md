# üß© Schema Documentation

This document outlines the data models used in the **Plansmart** application. All major user types‚Äî**Guest Speaker**, **Vendor**, and **Transportation Provider**‚Äîshare a unified structure supported by reusable schemas like **Portfolio** and **ClientReview**.

## üîó Schema Relationships Overview

The `GuestSpeaker`, `Vendor`, and `TransportationProvider` schemas share a common structure and are interrelated through the `Portfolio` and `ClientReview` schemas.

### Portfolio Integration

Each major entity includes a **Portfolio** field that enables them to showcase past work, media content, awards, and descriptions of their services. This field is based on the shared `PortfolioSchema`.

### Client Reviews Association

Each provider can receive multiple reviews from clients. These are stored as an array of entries using the `ClientReviewSchema`, allowing the system to dynamically calculate and display a provider‚Äôs average rating.

### Shared Structure

All provider schemas share the following core fields:

- **Name**
- **Email**
- **Phone**
- **Password**
- **isVerified** (Boolean flag for identity verification)
- **Portfolio** (work showcase)
- **Reviews** (array of client feedback)
- **Rating** (auto-calculated average score)
- **ProfilePhoto**

This consistency promotes maintainability and scalability as new user types are added.
